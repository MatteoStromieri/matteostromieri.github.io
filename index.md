## About Me
I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at *University of Haifa*, supervised by Amos Korman and Emanuele Natale. My research sits at the intersection of algorithms and the natural sciences, focusing on **Complex Systems** and **Distributed Computing**, particularly their manifestations in biological contexts. My toolkit includes classical algorithmic and probabilistic methods from theoretical computer science, with a touch of machine learning, helping algorithms see what pen and paper can’t.

My previous projects include work on **succinct data structures** and **distributed deep learning**. Beyond my core research areas, I am broadly curious about **Dynamical Systems**, **Combinatorics**, **Games**, **Geometry**, and the interface between theory and real-world phenomena.

## Research Interests
- **Bio-inspired Algorithms**
- **Complex Systems**
