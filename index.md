## About Me
I am a Master's student in Computer Science and an incoming PhD candidate in Theoretical Computer Science at *Haifa University*, in collaboration with *INRIA*. My research lies at the intersection of algorithms and the natural sciences, with primary interests in **Complex Systems**, **Distributed Computing**, and **Stochastic Processes**. Currently, I’m working on the *Distributed Foraging Hypothesis* (no spoilers), exploring how theoretical insights can emerge from models inspired by nature. 

My past projects span **succinct data structures**, **distributed deep learning**, and **applications of deep learning to neuroscience**. I am broadly curious about **Dynamical Systems**, **Computational Biology**, **Topology**, and the interface between theory and the physical world. Ultimately, I believe that resolving deep questions like **P ≠ NP** may require uncovering profound connections between theoretical computer science and the structure of the real world.
